         <p>Every project starts with a conversation. First I want to know what you wish to achieve and what is your idea for the mural. Let’s start this conversation right away through the enquiry form on the <a href="/contact" class="body-text-link">Contact page.</a></p>

         <p>Second — you decide about the type of service that best suits your needs. I offer two types of service: Design & Make and Make Only. If you are unsure, let’s talk and decide together.</p>

               <p>You will provide the image design (if needed, we will adapt it together for the mural technique), and I will transfer it into a sgraffito on the <nobr>selected wall.</nobr></p>

         <p>Next, I will visit the site for the sgraffito mural. This allows me to prepare a project plan and an estimated quote.</p>
			<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
         <p>It depends. Mainly on the size of the sgraffito and the complexity of design. But there are other factors too: project timeframe, selected materials, location of the mural (ceilings and walls with difficult access may require scaffoldings), location of the site (projects outside of the Grater London area may include travel costs).</p>
         <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
         <p>Again, it depends. Mainly on the size and complexity of the sgraffito. A small sgraffito can be normally made in days, a large one in weeks. In some cases I team up with selected sgraffito artists to deliver projects of larger sizes or in shorter timeframes. To get a better idea about the turnaround times, please take a look at example murals in the <a href="/gallery" class="body-text-link">Gallery page.</a></p>

      <div id="offer-4" class="section-block paragraph less-padding-top">
         <p>When you accept the quote, I start to design the sgraffito. This is done with pen and paper, water colours, in some cases Photoshop mockups.</p>
         <p>If you chose the Design &amp; Make service, I will design a new unique sgraffito based on your preferences. If you chose the Make Only service, I will work together with you to make sure your own design can be technically made into a sgraffito mural.</p>
         <p>We will spend enough time to arrive at a design that you like a lot.</p>

         <p>Finally, I will make the sgraffito on the designated wall based on a design that you accept. This may take several days; during this time I will prepare the wall, mix and tint the plasters, apply plaster layers, and remove parts of top layers to reveal the sgraffito image. </p>
