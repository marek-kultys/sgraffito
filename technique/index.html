         <p>Sgraffito mural is made by applying several layers of tinted plaster one on top of another, onto a wettened masonry or concrete wall. Then selected parts of front layers are removed by scratching to reveal coloured layers underneath into a designed image. Because a sgraffito mural is made of plaster, it provides both protection for the wall and unique decoration for the space.</p>
