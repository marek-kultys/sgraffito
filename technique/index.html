         <p>Sgraffito mural is made by applying several layers of tinted mortar one on top of another, onto a wettened masonry or concrete wall. Then selected parts of front layers are removed by scratching to reveal coloured layers underneath into a designed image. Because a sgraffito mural is made of mortar, it provides both protection for the wall and unique decoration for the space.</p>

         <p>Sgraffito is known to have been used since the antiquity. It was revived and popularised during the Renaissance age. Today, few artists master the technique, so every new sgraffito mural is not only unique for its design, but also rare for the technique. Here are some excellent examples of sgraffito art that I admire by mural painters from around the world.</p>
