         <p>Sgraffito mural is made by applying several layers of tinted plaster one on top of another, onto a wettened masonry or concrete wall. Then selected parts of front layers are removed by scratching to reveal coloured layers underneath into a designed image. Because a sgraffito mural is made of plaster, it provides both protection for the wall and unique decoration for the space.</p>

         <p>Sgraffito is known to have been used since the classical antiquity. It was revived and popularised during the Renaissance age. Today few artists master the technique, so every new sgraffito mural is not only unique for its design, but also rare for its technique. Here are some well known examples of sgraffito art by acclaimed mural painters from around the world that I admire.</p>
