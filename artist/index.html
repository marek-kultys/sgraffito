      <div class="section-block paragraph">
         <p>I graduated with a Master of Fine Arts degree from Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London in 2011. Before that I studied Painting at Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts where I mastered the techniques of sgraffito, mural, and canvas painting.</p>

         <p>I have been creating commissioned sgraffito murals since 2007.</p>

         <p>Since 2008 I has been actively exhibiting canvas work in art shows (London, Stockholm, Vienna, Turin, Berlin, Warsaw, Bucharest), and art fairs (London, Manchester, Rotterdam). In 2011 I won the Cass Art Painting Prize. Between 2012 and 2016 I was represented by Maria Stenfors.</p>

         <p>This space is dedicated to my sgraffito work. You can view my canvas painting on my <a href="http://www.melayerka.com" class="body-text-link">personal website.</a></p>
