               <h3>Trowel & Lime creates sgraffito.</h3>
               <p>Sgraffito is a beautiful traditional mural technique originating from ancient Rome and rediscovered in Renaissance. It is renowned for its durability, resilience to the elements and a monochromatic imagery. Sgraffito is a subtle way of giving the space texture, colour and light.</p>
